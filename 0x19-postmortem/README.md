# Web Stack Debugging Outage - Postmortem

![I think we're passed the point where rebooting can help](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.4928173b6f158bacc110de846fab76db?rik=2OZFOJM%2fJVxtvA&pid=ImgRaw&r=0)

**Incident Overview**

- **Duration:** October 15, 2023, 08:00 AM to 10:30 AM (UTC)
- **Impact:**
  - Authentication service disruptions led to a 20% decrease in active sessions. Some users tried to login with the hope that persistence is the key, but alas!

**Timeline**

- **08:00 AM:** Unplanned authentication service downtime detected. In the world of perfect servers, this wouldn't have happened.
- **08:05 AM:** Alerting system triggered. Our systems screamed louder than my morning coffee maker.
- **08:10 AM:** Initial analysis suspected database issues. Someone thought the database was on a coffee break.
- **08:30 AM:** Attempted database negotiation, no success. It seems databases can be stubborn.
- **09:00 AM:** System reliability team engaged for deeper investigation. The real heroes wear capes (or use Linux).
- **09:30 AM:** Root cause identified: Load balancer configuration error. Turns out, even technology suffers from a bad hair day.
- **10:00 AM:** Load balancer configuration corrected. The digital hair straightener did the trick!

**Root Cause and Resolution**

- **Root Cause:** Load balancer misconfiguration resulted in service disruption. Even our machines need a map sometimes.
- **Resolution:** Load balancer settings were adjusted to restore normal service. We politely asked the load balancer to get its act together.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures**

1. **Configuration Validation:**
   - **To Do:** Implement regular configuration reviews to prevent similar misconfigurations. We're creating a checklist longer than a CVS receipt.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - **To Do:** Strengthen monitoring systems to quickly identify anomalies. We'll give our systems a pair of glasses.

3. **Team Training:**
   - **To Do:** Conduct training sessions to enhance team awareness and response. Because machines need motivation too.

4. **Review and Update Protocols:**
   - **To Do:** Regularly review and update incident response protocols. Even protocols need a wardrobe change.

5. **Documentation Audit:**
   - **To Do:** Review and update documentation to reflect the latest configurations. Because outdated manuals are so last season.

**Conclusion**

The disruption was traced back to a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. Immediate corrective actions were taken to rectify the issue and prevent a recurrence. Moving forward, we commit to reinforcing our systems, improving monitoring, and conducting regular training sessions to ensure a resilient and reliable service. Our dedication to continuous improvement remains unwavering, even if our servers occasionally need a pep talk.
