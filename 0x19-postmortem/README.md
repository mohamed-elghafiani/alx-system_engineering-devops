**Uh-Oh! Our Authentication Service Needed a Coffee Break**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** October 15, 2023, 08:00 AM to 10:30 AM (UTC)
- **Impact:**
  - The authentication service decided to go on an unscheduled coffee break.
  - Users felt a bit neglected, with a 20% drop in active sessions.

- **Root Cause:** Our load balancer mistook the database for a coffee machine.

### Timeline
- **08:00 AM:** Coffee brewing, authentication service refusing to cooperate.
- **08:05 AM:** Monitoring system yelling louder than the coffee machine.
- **08:10 AM:** Initial suspicion: Database wanted its coffee first.
- **08:30 AM:** Tried convincing the database to work, but it preferred its caffeine fix.
- **09:00 AM:** Called in the system reliability team, but the database was already on its second cup.
- **09:30 AM:** Load balancer finally confessed it was trying to share the morning coffee joy.
- **10:00 AM:** Load balancer's settings were reminded they're in charge of databases, not coffee.

### Root Cause and Resolution
- **Root Cause:** Load balancer mistook database for a coffee machine, causing a java-related crisis.
- **Resolution:** Load balancer settings corrected; authentication service now wide awake.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures
1. **Coffee Breaks Only for Humans:**
   - **To Do:** Remind load balancer that databases prefer SQL queries over coffee grounds.

2. **Monitoring with an Espresso Shot:**
   - **To Do:** Install espresso machines next to servers for emergency database pick-me-ups.

3. **Database Barista Training:**
   - **To Do:** Conduct a crash course for load balancer on database vs. coffee machine distinctions.

4. **Load Balancer Stand-Up Comedy Night:**
   - **To Do:** Organize a tech comedy night to lighten the load balancer's mood.

5. **Regular “Tech Standup” Meetings:**
   - **To Do:** Initiate regular standup meetings for the tech team, whether the load balancer likes it or not.

### Conclusion
In the unpredictable tech world, even machines need a coffee break. Our load balancer tried to spread some morning cheer but ended up confusing servers for espresso machines. With a dash of humor, a sip of patience, and a strong resolve, we've learned that sometimes, even technology needs its caffeine fix! ☕✨
